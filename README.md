## Set environment variables

You can either create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`) in the root of the project or set the following environment variables:

```bash
export AUTOBLOCKS_TEST_RUN_MESSAGE="Made prompt more concise"
```

```bash
export AUTOBLOCKS_V2_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

**Note:** You can get your Autoblocks API key from the [Autoblocks settings page](https://app-v2.autoblocks.ai/settings/api-keys).

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

**Note:** You can get your OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## Run the tests

```bash
poetry run run_tests
```

## Running in CI

First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

Then, set the following repository secrets:

1. `AUTOBLOCKS_V2_API_KEY`
2. `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Note:** You can view how these are used in the [`.github/workflows/autoblocks_tests.yml`](.github/workflows/autoblocks_tests.yml) file.

Now you can run the workflow in the Actions tab on the GitHub UI.

## View results

Go to your application at [app-v2.autoblocks.ai](https://app-v2.autoblocks.ai) and view the results.
